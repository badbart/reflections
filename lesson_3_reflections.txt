When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When i would like to work with others on the same Team or as an Backup of my stuff

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- So there arent't things on the remote thate aren't finished. A Feature could need multiple commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks and Clone are theoretically the same, they clone a repository. But a Fork can only be used at Github. When forking a repository, the forked repository is always shown at the new one
- Branches are used to create different ways or paths in a Repository
- Forks + Clones if i want to do something with an Repository but don't really want to push the data back to it
- Branches for example if i want to create some experimental features or something

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- Even if you have no internet connection you can check if there are merge conflicts when you try to push you changes to the remote
