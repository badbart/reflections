When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When i would like to work with others on the same Team or as an Backup of my stuff

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- So there arent't things on the remote thate aren't finished. A Feature could need multiple commits
